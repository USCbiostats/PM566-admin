<h1>Learning goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>merge()</code> function to join two datasets.</li>
<li>Deal with missings and impute data.</li>
<li>Identify relevant observations using <code>quantile()</code>.</li>
<li>Practice your GitHub skills.</li>
</ul>

<div id="lab-description" class="section level1">
<h1>Lab description</h1>
<p>For this lab we will be, again, dealing with the meteorological dataset downloaded from the NOAA, the <code>met</code>. In this case, we will use <code>data.table</code> to answer some questions regarding the <code>met</code> dataset, while at the same time practice your Git+GitHub skills for this project.</p>
<p>This markdown document should be rendered using <code>github_document</code> document.</p>

<div id="part-1-setup-the-git-project-and-the-github-repository" class="section level1">
<h1>Part 1: Setup the Git project and the GitHub repository</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Go to your documents (or wherever you are planning to store the data) in your computer, and create a folder for this project, for example, “PM566-labs”</p></li>
<li><p>In that folder, save <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/PM566/master/content/assignment/05-lab.Rmd">this template</a> as “README.Rmd”. This will be the markdown file where all the magic will happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository, hopefully of the same name that this folder has, i.e., “PM566-labs”.</p></li>
<li><p>Initialize the Git project, add the “README.Rmd” file, and make your first commit.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the repo you just created on GitHub.com to the list of remotes, and push your commit to origin while setting the upstream.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the steps can be done using command line:</p>
<pre class="sh"><code># Step 1
cd ~/Documents
mkdir PM566-labs
cd PM566-labs

# Step 2
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/PM566/master/content/assignment/05-lab.Rmd 
mv 05-lab.Rmd README.md

# Step 3
# Happens on github

# Step 4
git init
git add README.Rmd
git commit -m &quot;First commit&quot;

# Step 5
git remote add origin git@github.com:[username]/PM566-labs
git push -u origin master</code></pre>
<p>You can also complete the steps in R (replace with your paths/username when needed)</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Step 1
setwd(&quot;~/Documents&quot;)
dir.create(&quot;PM566-labs&quot;)
setwd(&quot;PM566-labs&quot;)

# Step 2
download.file(
  &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/PM566/master/content/assignment/05-lab.Rmd&quot;,
  destfile = &quot;README.Rmd&quot;
  )

# Step 3: Happens on Github

# Step 4
system(&quot;git init &amp;&amp; git add README.Rmd&quot;)
system(&#39;git commit -m &quot;First commit&quot;&#39;)

# Step 5
system(&quot;git remote add origin git@github.com:[username]/PM566-labs&quot;)
system(&quot;git push -u origin master&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done setting up the project, you can now start working with the MET data.</p>
<div id="setup-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup in R</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Load the <code>data.table</code> (and the <code>dtplyr</code> and <code>dplyr</code> packages if you plan to work with those).</p></li>
<li><p>Load the met data from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz" class="uri">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USCbiostats/data-science-data/master/02_met/met_all.gz</a>, and also the station data. For the later, you can use the code we used during lecture to pre-process the stations data:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Download the data
stations &lt;- fread(&quot;ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv&quot;)
stations[, USAF := as.integer(USAF)]

# Dealing with NAs and 999999
stations[, USAF   := fifelse(USAF == 999999, NA_integer_, USAF)]
stations[, CTRY   := fifelse(CTRY == &quot;&quot;, NA_character_, CTRY)]
stations[, STATE  := fifelse(STATE == &quot;&quot;, NA_character_, STATE)]

# Selecting the three relevant columns, and keeping unique records
stations &lt;- unique(stations[, list(USAF, CTRY, STATE)])

# Dropping NAs
stations &lt;- stations[!is.na(USAF)]

# Removing duplicates
stations[, n := 1:.N, by = .(USAF)]
stations &lt;- stations[n == 1,][, n := NULL]</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Merge the data as we did during the lecture.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="question-1-representative-station-for-the-us" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 1: Representative station for the US</h2>
<p>What is the median station in terms of temperature, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure? Look for the three weather stations that best represent continental US using the <code>quantile()</code> function. Do these three coincide?</p>
<p>Knit the document, commit your changes, and Save it on GitHub. Don’t forget to add <code>README.md</code> to the tree, the first time you render it.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2-representative-station-per-state" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 2: Representative station per state</h2>
<p>Just like the previous question, you are asked to identify what is the most representative, the median, station per state. This time, instead of looking at one variable at a time, look at the euclidean distance. If multiple stations show in the median, select the one located at the lowest latitude.</p>
<p>Knit the doc and save it on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3-in-the-middle" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 3: In the middle?</h2>
<p>For each state, identify what is the station that is closest to the mid-point of the state. Combining these with the stations you identified in the previous question, use <code>leaflet()</code> to visualize all ~100 points in the same figure, applying different colors for those identified in this question.</p>
<p>Knit the doc and save it on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-4-means-of-means" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 4: Means of means</h2>
<p>Using the <code>quantile()</code> function, generate a summary table that shows the number of states included, average temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure by the variable “average temperature level,” which you’ll need to create.</p>
<p>Start by computing the states’ average temperature. Use that measurement to classify them according to the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>low: temp &lt; 20</li>
<li>Mid: temp &gt;= 20 and temp &lt; 25</li>
<li>High: temp &gt;= 25</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are done with that, you can compute the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of entries (records),</li>
<li>Number of NA entries,</li>
<li>Number of stations,</li>
<li>Number of states included, and</li>
<li>Mean temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>All by the levels described before.</p>
<p>Knit the document, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub. If you’d like, you can take this time to include the link of <a href="https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566/issues/23">the issue of the week</a> so that you let us know when you are done, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>git commit -a -m &quot;Finalizing lab 5 https://github.com/USCbiostats/PM566/issues/23&quot;</code></pre>
